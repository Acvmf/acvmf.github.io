summary: A simple shell written in Java.

Over the course of several iterations, I developed a simple command-line shell in Java.

It supports cd, piped commands, and other basic functionality using ProcessBuilders.

It does not currently support sudo.

You may find the code at https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6T4luuBpxZCd1NTdjUtcmRrQWs - it is currently only open to University of Hawaii logins, or on request.
