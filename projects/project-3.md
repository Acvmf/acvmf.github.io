summary: A simple shell written in Java.

Over the course of several iterations, I developed a simple command-line shell in Java.

It supports cd, piped commands, and other basic functionality using ProcessBuilders.

It does not currently support sudo.

For the full requirements of the project, please refer to the class website: [Part 1](https://schastel.github.io/fa2016_ics332/morea/040_Processes/experience-jsh1.html) [Part 2](https://schastel.github.io/fa2016_ics332/morea/050_Threads/experience-jsh2.html) [Part 3](https://schastel.github.io/fa2016_ics332/morea/070_Synchronization/experience-jsh3.html)

I cannot provide the full code for download, in order to preserve academic standards, but hope to have a demo video up as soon as I can film one.
