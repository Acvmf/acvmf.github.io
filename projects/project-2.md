This project builds on the Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (AIMA) codebase available on github.com/aimacode.

The code is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6T4luuBpxZCeUx3YkxSazcxQUE?usp=sharing

A readme is available in that folder.

I have modified the "Agents" portion of the code to improve the environment and AI of the vacuum bot. It now uses cans and bottles rather than dirt, and deposits them in a recycling bin.

In future iterations of the project, it will map out the room and use a better algorithm for avoiding walls and finding objects.
