summary: I have a personal website where I host a number of small projects, including a few class projects.

This is a temporary arrangement; I plan to make a proper landing page and open permissions for most projects at some time soon.

My class projects are closed off so as to avoid enabling plagiarism by current students of those classes.

The KEL site was a first draft of a website I made for an employer. It ended up not being used, as she wanted to be able to support it herself and therefore switched to a different site building service. That site taught me how to use php for logins, cookies, and session tests. The session test link is a part of that experience.

The php info page is just for my own convenience.

Like I said, I'm going to edit the page as well as this one, but this will do for now.
