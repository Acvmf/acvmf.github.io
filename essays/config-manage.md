## Welcome to the control center
Configuration management is an important skill for anyone who works with software. There are plenty of programs which help with this - Subversion, GitHub, even the old but strong SCCS built into Unix. No large-scale project has been successful without some amount of version control, even if only one developer has worked on it. I'd like to take a moment to explore what makes this part of software engineering so vital, and how we can go about using it to benefit our projects.
